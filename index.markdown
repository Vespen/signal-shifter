**Signal Shifter** is a tiny application that lives in the Menu Bar.

The application creates a complete list of your input audio devices, output audio devices and Bluetooth devices that can
be used as audio input or output. This way, you have all your audio sources in a single place.

You can easily toggle between default devices and enable or disable Bluetooth devices.
