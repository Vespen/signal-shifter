**Signal Shifter** is a tiny application that lives in the Menu Bar.

The application creates a complete list of your input audio devices, output audio devices, and Bluetooth devices that can be
used as audio input or output. This way, you have all your audio sources in a single place.

You can easily toggle between default devices, adjust input and output volume, mute them, and enable or disable Bluetooth
devices. It tracks Bluetooth battery levels and sends low-battery notifications.
